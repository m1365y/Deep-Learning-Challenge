# Deep Learning Assignment Summary: Predicting Charitable Funding Success

In this assignment, a neural network was designed to predict the success of charitable donations. The primary steps taken include:

## Data Preprocessing:

The data was meticulously processed, with categorical variables having many distinct values being grouped into an "Other" category. This binning simplifies the model while preserving essential information.
Scaling was executed using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have equal weight in the model, enhancing its predictive accuracy.

## Model Design & Training:

Multiple neural networks were experimented with, each varying in hidden layer structures and nodes.
Every model underwent training for a specific number of epochs, revealing insights into the behavior of the model over time.

## Performance Evaluation:

The best-performing model was close to achieving the target accuracy of 75%. This signifies that the model has learned patterns within the data and can predict with reasonable certainty.

## Recommendations & Future Steps:

While the overall results are promising, there is room for improvement. Incorporating techniques like early-stopping can help in mitigating over-fitting and enhancing model efficiency.
A written analysis will be incorporated in future projects to provide context and comprehensive insights into the findings.
In conclusion, mastering deep learning techniques, particularly with TensorFlow, is pivotal for accurate predictive modeling. This project showcased an ability to process data adeptly, design, and train neural networks, and assess model performance with a critical lens.
